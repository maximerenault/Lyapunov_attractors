# Lyapunov_attractors
Short code that generates beautiful images from pseudo-random number generation and chaotic series. With these settings you can have approximately 3 images for a thousand tests.
Original inspiration from Paul Bourke http://paulbourke.net/fractals/lyapunov/ .

I also integrated a way to reproduce results even though they were generated at random, and so be able to change the color or the size of the image (for a big print for example).

With the option 'video' you can also generate an animated version of these figures in mp4 format.
